        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <blockquote id=bq3>
            Brand Owner, Beautician with experience in cosmetics, business development, fashion and management.
            <br><br>
            My passion is in business development and progression. I am a former sales associate and hostess, giving me the experience of communications and consumer care. My experience in both positions has been essential to my success.
            <br><br>
            After many years of working in multiple customer service, I have made my way into the cosmetics & beauty industry. I am currently a licensed cosmetologist with professions in lashes, brows, makeup, and nail technology. I manage a nail salon in all aspects such as accounting, customer service, employment responsibilities, and organization. 
            I have also launched my own fashion line where I market, develop, network, creative direct and process all inventory and financial aspects of the brand. My current position has supplied me with new skills and clear insight on developing the business and reaching out and networking. 
            <br><br>
            I have attended Chandler Gilbert CC. as a Business Management Major and graduated from Mesa CC. as a Fashion Management Major with a certificate in Retail Sales Management. I have also finished my bachelors in Design Management/Studies at Arizona State University.
